# TicTacTortex
Neural Network based machine learning has been around since the '70s, and is catching on today as the hot way to process machine vision tasks like OCR and pattern matching, and capture voice as text. It's been described as the second best solution to any problem.

## Goal
The goal of this repository, for me, is to demonstrate basic mastery of neural networks and their capabilities. This includes multi-layer neural networks, though not Deep Convolutional Neural Networks or any of the very fancy stuff (see other repos for that). In order to do this, you will find in this repo, a few things.

## Features
* A basic 3-layer neural network including one hidden layer,
* A neural network trainer, that uses _Tic Tac Toe_ game data
* A genetic algorithm program program that attempts to train two neural networks by pitting them against each other in actual games of _Tic Tac Toe_.
